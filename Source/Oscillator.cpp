     a piece-wise quadratic approximation has less harmonics weirdly, but this may sound better.
     trying out avoiding true sine waves, i dont think they are interesting or sound good.
     this will eventually be replaced/bolstered by more robust waveshaping
     this has the harmonic series of sin(nx)/n^3, as if it was the second interpolation of a saw, the way a triangle is the first interpolation of a square.*/
